### Where to get the client identifier and secret

Each identity provider has a process for creating an app registration. For example, users create an app registration with Facebook at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/). The resulting client identifier and client secret can be passed to [create identityProvider](../api/identitycontainer-post-identityproviders.md). Then, each user object in the directory can be federated to any of the tenant's identity providers for authentication. This enables the user to sign in by entering credentials on the identity provider's sign-in page. The token from the identity provider is validated by Microsoft Entra ID before the tenant issues a token to the application.
